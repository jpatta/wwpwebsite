        <p>Globally, 2 billion people (26% of the population) do not have safe drinking water 
            and 3.6 billion (46%) lack access to safely managed sanitation. 
            The global urban population facing water scarcity is projected 
            to double from 930 million in 2016 to 1.7–2.4 billion people in 2050. 
            The growing incidence of extreme and prolonged droughts is also stressing ecosystems, 
            with dire consequences for both plant and animal species. (Unesco, March 2023)
